# Football-Predictions

Final year project. Files include results data and virtual data - plus all the datasets from pre-processing and feature engineering.

The order the project is designed to run in is - FIFA_Data_Preprocessing.ipynb, Join_datasets.ipynb, Project_Data_Analysis.ipynb - 
Project_classification.ipynb & Regression.ipynb

However all the files are included, so it is not necessary to run everything.

The project predicts Premier League results, using multiple machine learning techniques for both classification and regression including: Random Forest Classifier and Regressor, Artificial Neural Network Classifier and Regressor, Support Vector Machine classification and regression using, Poly, RBF and Linear kernels. 

There is mutiple combinations of data - real data - virtual data - mixed data (real and virtual) which are tested to see which set of data gives the best performance. 

**Software Requirements**

Python (3.8 or newer)
Python libraries - Pandas, NumPy, SciKit-Learn, matplotlib, seaborn.
