# Football-Predictions

Final year project. Files include results data and virtual data - plus all the datasets from pre-processing and feature engineering.

Python notebook files. 

The order the project is designed to run in is - FIFA_Data_Preprocessing.ipynb, Join_datasets.ipynb, Project_Data_Analysis.ipynb - 
Project_classification.ipynb & Regression.ipynb

However all the files are included, so it is not necessary to run everything.
